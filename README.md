### Ticket System

A ticket system application that allows users to create, view, and manage tickets. Users can create an account, log in, and create tickets. Each ticket can be assigned to a user, and users can view all tickets assigned to them.  The application is built with Next.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Prisma, and LuciaAuth.

**PD: This system does not have a role or permission system, meaning that all users can access all features.**

 **In the future, I plan to host this repository on a website, showcasing all my projects. Additionally, I intend to add a blog where I will discuss the process of building each project, the challenges I encountered, and how I overcame them. I will also share my thought process when approaching a new projectâ€”detailing how I break down tasks, determine requirements, and design solutions to ensure everything functions smoothly.**
